# si-api
API to use in conjunction with the StudioIntern SaaS

## Purpose of this project
This is the StudioIntern API **description** made with Stoplight Studio. 
Please consider that this project does not contain the StudioIntern API itself. 

But, it may help you to create your clients for using the StudioIntern API.

## Contributing
If you like, you can send me hints and critics regarding the structure or 
other ideas. Especially, when you are a StudioIntern customer (or the customer's internet guru) 
any proposals are welcome.
